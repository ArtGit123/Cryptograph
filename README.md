# Cryptograph
This is a cryptograph that uses the Caesar Cipher which is an encryption technique tthat shifts the alphabet by a certain value (the key). For example, if the key was 3, then A would be D, B -> E, C -> F ... X -> A, Y -> B and Z -> C. This is quite a simple and easy to break cipher. This is the Caesar Cipher, coded in Java with an encryptor and decryptor.
